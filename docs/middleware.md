## Middleware Documentation
Hey there, fellow dev! Weâ€™ve got a batch of middlewares ready for you to add some serious functionality to your Go web app. Each of these middlewares brings its own magicâ€”security, logging, timeouts, and more! Letâ€™s break them down one by one. ðŸ‘‡

### Authentication Middleware (JWT)
Our AuthMiddleware helps protect your routes with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Itâ€™s flexible, letting you customize the secret key, error handling, and token extraction method.

Setup
To get started, configure your JWT settings using JWTConfig:

* SecretKey: The secret key for signing JWTs.
* SigningMethod: The JWT signing algorithm.
* ErrorHandler: Custom error handler for handling auth errors (optional).
* TokenExtractor: Extracts the token from the request header (optional).

### Example

```go
import (
	"github.com/BrunoCiccarino/GopherLight/middleware"
)

config := middleware.JWTConfig{
	SecretKey: []byte("your_secret_key"),
}
app.Use(middleware.NewAuthMiddleware(config))
```

### CORS Middleware
Need to allow cross-origin requests? No problem! Our CORSMiddleware configures the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings to make your API accessible from other domains.

Config Options
* AllowOrigin: Set to "*" to allow any origin or specify a domain (e.g., "http://example.com").
* AllowMethods: Which HTTP methods are allowed? Common choices include "GET", "POST", etc.
* AllowHeaders: Specify which headers clients can use.
* AllowCredentials: Set to true if you want cookies or HTTP auth to be included.
* ExposeHeaders: Let the client read specific headers from the response.
* MaxAge: Cache time (in seconds) for preflight requests.

### Example
```go
corsOptions := middleware.CORSOptions{
	AllowOrigin: "*",
	AllowMethods: []string{"GET", "POST"},
}
app.Use(middleware.CORSMiddleware(corsOptions))
```

### CSRF Middleware
Our CSRFMiddleware protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery by validating a CSRF token sent with each request. Use GenerateCSRFToken() to create a secure token, then validate it with your own isValidToken function.

### Example

```go
app.Use(middleware.CSRFMiddleware(func(token string) bool {
	return token == "your_valid_token"
}))
```

And donâ€™t forget to generate tokens with:
```go
csrfToken := middleware.GenerateCSRFToken()
```

### Logging Middleware
Want to keep track of whatâ€™s happening on your server? LoggingMiddleware logs each request, including the method, path, and time taken. Itâ€™s a great way to stay informed on app performance and any unusual activity.

### Example
```go
app.Use(middleware.LoggingMiddleware)
```
Each request will be logged like this:

* Started: Logs the request start time.
* Completed: Logs when the request finishes, including the duration.

### Timeout Middleware
Avoid those endless waits by setting time limits on request processing with TimeoutMiddleware. This middleware will cancel the request if it doesnâ€™t complete in time, sending a 504 Gateway Timeout status to the client.

### Example
```go
import (
	"time"
	"github.com/BrunoCiccarino/GopherLight/middleware"
)

timeout := 2 * time.Second
app.Use(middleware.TimeoutMiddleware(timeout))
```

Putting It All Together
Alright, now that youâ€™re equipped with JWT auth, CORS controls, CSRF protection, request logging, and request timeouts, youâ€™re ready to make your app secure, flexible, and robust! Mix and match these middlewares as needed, and build a resilient API like a pro. Go forth and code!
